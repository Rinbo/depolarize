A news app with a twist. Upon reaching the landing page the user gets asked for their political affiliation. Depending on their choice they get served news from a News Paper that is leaning to the opposite end of the political spectrum compared to what hey picked. The idea is that polarization is becoming an increasing problem in our societies. A democracy needs discourse to be able to function, and that is the problem that this site aims to alleviate. By being served thoughtful and well writte essays and editorials from the other side of the isle, the hope is that the user will not as locked in by echo chambers and outraged by people thinking differently.

The app has been created with Ruby on Rails and is fully tested with Rspec and Cucumber. The news API we are using is www.newsapi.org. Find the live site here: https://depolarize.herokuapp.com/
